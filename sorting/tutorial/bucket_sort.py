"""
Bucket sort is a unique algorithm which works much better than the other sorting algorithms in O(n) time.

The idea behind it is when we have an array which has a fixed number of values (range between 0-2 etc), we can store it's occurrences in a
separate array - referred to as a bucket. After this we can loop through the bucket and add to the original array, looping through the number of
occurrences.
