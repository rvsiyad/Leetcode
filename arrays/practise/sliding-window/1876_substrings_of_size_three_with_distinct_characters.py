class SubstringsOfSizeThree:
  """
  A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

  Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

  Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

  A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

  Example:
  Input: s = "xyzzaz"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz".
  The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
