class twoPointer:
  """
  Two pointer is like the parent of the sliding window technique. The main idea for Two Pointer
  is having a L (left) and R (right) pointer, both starting at some index of the array. The starting
  points for the L and R pointer really depends on the problem at hand.

  The concept:
  - Start with a L pointer at index 0
  - R pointer at index arr.length - 1
  - Increment or decrement the R or L pointer, depending on the conditions for the given problem.
